# RayEngine
GPU Accelerated ray tracing gaming engine

Third year/masters/whole life Swansea university project. 

RayEngine is a GPU accelerated ray-tracing gaming engine

## TODO: 
  * Improve memory management on kernel calls.
  * Implement SAH kd-tree construction.
  * Clean CUDA code.
  * Implement texturing
  * Improve scene management by not loading same mesh multiple times
  * Further develop game logic manageme
  * Implement collision detection ( possibly handle on CPU on different threads)
  * Implement anti-aliasing

  
## Implemented:
  * CPU Ray tracing
  * GPU CUDA Ray Tracing
  * Kd-tree acceleration structure
  * Support for different object types
  * PLY file reader
  * OBJ file reader
  * Normal interpolation
  * Refractions and reflections
  * Multiple movable light sources
  * Dynamic camera
  * Object transformation
  * Complex scene structure
  * Multiple materials
  * Framework for game logic
  * Sky sphere
  * Camera collision tests
